To add ans use a Slider, you need to follow these steps:
1) Add this html code where you want your slider to appear:
    <div class="slider">
        <div class="imgs">
            <div class="img"><img src="../../resources/img/cat.png" alt="" class="link" id="/"></div>
            <div class="img"><img src="../../resources/img/cat-green.png" alt=""></div>
            <div class="img"><img src="../../resources/img/cat-red.png" alt=""></div>
            <div class="img"><img src="../../resources/img/cat-white.png" alt=""></div>
            <!-- Add more if you want -->
        </div>
        <!--Arrows are added dynamically-->
    </div>
2) Modify it by adding more images (at least 4 images)
3) if you want an image to be a link, add the class "link" and the id "PATH_OF_LINK" to the <img> where PATH_OF_LINK is the path of the link
4) In your html file, you need to include slider.js
5) In your own javascript file (slider.js has to be included before), you have to add the following to be sure that the slider works properly:
    const slider= new Slider(".slider",RESIZE,1)
    slider.activate()
6) Modify it by changing the RESIZE variable. This variable is an array defining the width of the slider depending on the width of the screen.
   This variable is an array [[screen_width1,slider_width1],[screen_width2,slider_width2],...,[null,last_slider_width]]
